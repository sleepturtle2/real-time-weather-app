# Real Time Weather App
This web app displays the live weathersun_behind_large_cloud data of any place you want to know!

It is created by using Node.js and Express.js.

The temperature is accessed by using the WeatherAPI, which provides us with frequently updated weather. It is available for both free as well as paid subscriptions!
